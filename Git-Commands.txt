To remove a Git commit permanently from history

1- Identify the commit

$ git log

2- Run the interactive rebase command

$ git rebase -i <hash-commit>^

i-> The ^ character at the end indicates that you want to include the commit before the specified commit in the rebase.
ii-> replace <hash-commit> with the hash of the commit identified
iii-> This will open an editor with a list of all the commits since the specified commit. Find the line that corresponds to the commit you want to remove and delete it
iv-> Save and close the editor
v-> Resolve commits, if any. And then continue rebase with 'git rebase --continue' command

3- Push the changes

$ git push --force origin my-branch
